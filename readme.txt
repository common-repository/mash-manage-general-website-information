Mash General Information allows users to manage site information & location Schema brought out in the site header, footer and contact page.

== Description ==

Mash General Information gives developers the opportunity to offer their clients the full content managed experience. By simply adding dynamic PHP code to your website theme, you are enabling your clients to be able to fully manage theme options that are often found in headers, footers and on contact us pages. 

The plugin also generates location schema based on the user information entered. You are then generated either a short code for use throughout the backend of Wordpress or a basic snippet of PHP code to call throughout your themes template files.

Clients can easily manage: 

* Telephone Numbers
* Addresses 
* Emails Addresses
* Strap lines
* Company Number
* Copyright Details
* Social Media URLS
